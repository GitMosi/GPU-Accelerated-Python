**IF IT DIDN'T WORK:

1- Open (Conda) Prompt.

2- Then Command this line:

	pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

	pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

	conda update conda

****IF IT DIDN'T WORK:

1. Check Available PyTorch Versions:

To find out what GPU versions are available for PyTorch, we can use the PyPI web interface:

    Go to https://pypi.org/search/
    In the search box, type "torch torchvision torchaudio"
    Look for entries with CUDA versions in their names or descriptions

2. Check PyTorch GitHub Repository:

For the most up-to-date information on available CUDA versions:

    Go to https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
    Look at the latest release notes
    Check the installation instructions for different CUDA versions
