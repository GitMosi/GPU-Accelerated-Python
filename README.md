# GPU Accelerated Python


Graphics processing units (GPUs) have a larger number of cores compared to central processing units (CPUs). As a result, GPUs exhibit better parallel data processing capabilities despite having a lower clock speed and lacking certain core management features typically found in CPUs. Consequently, running a Python script on a GPU can produce faster results than running it on a CPU. However, it is important to note that for processing the data must first be transferred to the GPU's memory, a step that can introduce additional time delays. In cases where the data set is relatively small, the CPU can outperform the GPU.

Read the steps on notes. Hope you could run codes on GPU! ;-)
